	class StateView:
		""" Class used to encapsulate the game state as seen by a player
		
		This class serves two purposes. It
		implements a better interface than
		a bare dict to access the state, and
		implements `__setstate__` and
		`__getstate__` so that it can be
		easily pickled.

		Usage
		-----

		```python
		state = game.active_state # Get StateView for active player
		valid_actions = state.valid_actions
		credit = state.credit
		hand_ranking, _ = eval_hand(state.player_hand)

		# Predict action
		action = predict(([credit, hand_ranking], valid_actions))
		over, _, _ = game.step(action)
		```

		State Attributes
		-----
		player : int
			Index of the player associated
			to this game state view.
		valid_actions : numpy array
			A one-hot encoded array of valid
			actions.
		num_players : int
			Number of players that started
			the game.
		turn : int
			The hand turn.
		player_cards : list of cards
			A 2-element list with the cards
			in the hand of the player.
		community_cards : list of cards
			A list with the community cards;
			the number of cards depends on
			the turn of the game.
		credits : numpy array
			A numpy array with shape
			`(num_players,)` with the credits
			of each player.
		bets : numpy array
			An array with shape `(num_players,)`
			where each element is the commited
			bet of that player in the current
			hand.
		pending_bets : numpy array
			An array with shape `(num_players,)`
			where each element is the amount
			bet by that player in this turn.
		minimum_raise_value : float
			The minimum bet required to make
			a raise.
		
		State Properties
		--------
		valid_action_indices : generator of ints
			A generator expression the yields
			the indices of the valid actions;
			can be used in place of the one-
			hot encoded array.
		player_hand : list of cards
			The player cards plus the
			community cards.
		pot : float
			The sum of all commited bets.
		credit : float
			The credit of the player captured
			by this view.
